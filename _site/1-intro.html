<p>One amazingly useful GitHub feature is <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
Gh-pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.</p>

<p>Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish instructional websites. 
For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">Programming Historian</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>, <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/">Library Carpentry</a></li>
  <li>this site!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note:
There are <em>soft</em> limits and guidelines for gh-pages usage: sites should be &lt; 1GB, use &lt; 100GB bandwidth per month, and make &lt; 10 builds per hour.
If your site exceeds these quotas, GitHub will send you a notice asking you to modify the repository.
All content must follow the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/">community guidelines</a>, e.g. no violence, obscene sex, or illegal stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="workshop-template">workshop-template</h1>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workshop-template</code> is a Jekyll project to create a simple workshop website, based on the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">Minima theme</a>, designed for hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">gh-pages</a>.</p>

<p>It works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus index, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the lessons.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
Itâ€™s easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and gh-pages makes this super easy.</p>

<p>It is a better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_blank">Open Educational Resource</a> since anyone can easily fork and adapt!</p>
