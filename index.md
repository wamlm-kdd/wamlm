## Overview

Machine learning applications are rapidly adopted by industry leaders in any field. The growth of investment in AI-driven solutions created new challenges in managing Data Science and ML resources, people and projects as a whole. The discipline of managing applied machine learning teams, requires a healthy mix between agile product development tool-set and a long term research oriented mindset.  The abilities of investing in deep research while at the same time connecting the outcomes to significant business results create a large knowledge based on management methods and best practices in the field. The Workshop on Applied Machine Learning Management brings together applied research managers from various fields to share methodologies and case-studies on management of ML teams, products, and projects, achieving business impact with advanced AI-methods.

## How to attend

The workshop is a part of the ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING that will happen in Washington DC Convention Center August 14-18, 2022, more information can be found on the official site of the conference: https://kdd.org/kdd2022/. In order to attend the workshop you need to register to the main conference. Registration will open soon. You don't need to submit a paper if you want to attend. The conference will be in person.

## Call for talk proposals

The workshop focuses on main aspects of a successful ML resource management: project lifecycle, people management and ML quality and excellence. We focus on a combination of soft skills applications along with data-driven and empirical approaches to efficiently resolve ML management challenges.

The ML projects life-cycle management include research resources allocation and collaboration with product development, to achieve innovative and applicable outcomes. We solicit presenting real case-studies and high level working model proposals. At the same time, the people management aspects include the unique properties of ML talents and the specific challenges in building AI organisations, fostering research culture and growing research driven individuals in a business driven environment.  Finally, the ML excellence topic include aspects of high-quality ML models and working processes, together with tooling and best practices to ensure them.

We solicit **talk proposals** for the plenary talks session. The proposals should be 0.25-1 page. We also invite **panel round-table** discussion proposals. Please include in the submission:

- Description of the talk/panel discussion:
  - Title
  - Abstract of the talk proposal or round table proposal
  - Potential discussion points
  - An explanation about relevance of this talk/panel discussion to the workshop
- Infor about the presenter:
  - A short bio of the main presenter (~100 words)
  - A brief company or project portrait (~60 words)
- Optional:
